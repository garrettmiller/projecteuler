#The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

#1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

#By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. 
#For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. 
#If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
